##Sync - Sync The Breath

Sync is a tool to help people realize the benefits of conscious, controlled breathing by providing users with visually guided breathing sequences.

Sync utilizes calming visualizations (made using Sass and CSS animations) to provide users with visual inhale/exhale cues.

The simple, minimalistic UI gets users breathing quickly and easily.

Users select a breather (pre-populated breathing sequence). Each breather has a total duration of 5 minutes and a set inhale-exhale ratio.
